Layout Suggestions：
Each web pages could have a common footer.
Designer could decide whether or not to keep the original home page styles.
The HTML form could be positioned on a new page, and this page should use the same layout as the students' pages do. 
For background, Designer can use some colors that fit the content of the webpage(mysterious and fanatastic.) Designer can try to use some background images of each characters. 
Design could use different color for the hover attribute on navigation.
F-pattern for three charcters' webpages and Z-pattern for the index. 

Typeface/Font Suggestion：
I suggest the designer to use fonts that add mysterious and marvellous moods to webpages.
The h1s need to be styled using fonts that are clear and powerful.
All the body paragraphs should use the same font.

About HTML Form：
For this assignment, the form should be used to vote for user's favorite characters among three.
create a login system and after they logged in, they should be directed to a webpage which user can vote for their favorite characters.  
the form should have : name of the users and their favorite characters(radiobutton will be simple and clear).
